Johannesburg - The Gauteng Department of Education on Friday said it was shocked and saddened to learn of the suicide of a Grade 11 pupil after he received his 2017 year-end report card.  According to the department, the pupil from Strauss Secondary School, Ekangala, was found hanging in the garage at home by his mother two days after he received his final report card.  Emergency Medical Services were subsequently called to the scene and the pupil was then transported to Dark City Local Clinic, where he was declared dead on arrival. "Trauma debriefing will be provided to all affected by this tragedy.  It is regrettable that such an incident occurred, as the department is working jointly with NGOs such as ChildLine South Africa," the department's Steve Mabona said. "Suicide is not an option since there is available intervention and support for pupils."

The department also urged parents and the community to closely monitor the behaviour of pupils and seek intervention timeously. Adding to this was Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi, who said: “The department appeals to learners not to commit suicide, and emphasise that, failing a grade does not signify the end, we all fail at some point; however, we must be encouraged to start over and strive to reach our desired goals". Pupils experiencing depression due to their poor academic performance were also encouraged to contact Childcare toll free line:  0800 055 555, or Childline Gauteng contact number: 011 645 2000.  IOL
