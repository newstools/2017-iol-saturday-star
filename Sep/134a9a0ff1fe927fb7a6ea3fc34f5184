Mvoko had in August last year appealed the high court in Joburg’s ruling to dismiss his application to have his three-year contract with the SABC protected. This after the SABC terminated his contract as the public broadcaster’s contributing editor when he spoke out against its controversial editorial policy not to televise visuals of violent protest action in May last year. The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa later found that the ban was illegal. Mvoko was one of the so-called “SABC 8” journalists  who challenged the protest ban and got fired in July 2016.    Seven of the SABC 8 were later reinstated after they filed an urgent application in the Labour Court to challenge their dismissals. However, Mvoko's case was different because he was a freelancer. The SABC has been ordered to pay the costs of the case. Mvoko tweeted on Friday: “YES...!!! WE’VE WON AGAINST THE #SABC & THE SCA HAS RULED THAT THE SABC MUST PAY COSTS OF THE CASE. AMANDLA! #NotInMyName.” Saturday Star
