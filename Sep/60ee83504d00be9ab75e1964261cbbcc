The seven-year-old boy from Brakpan brought a firearm loaded with live rounds of ammunition to school earlier this week to shoot a “bully” he claimed had been tormenting him. “The boy returned to school on yesterday (on Friday) and will spend his school holidays in counselling,” said Steve Mabona, spokesperson for the Department of Education. "We met with a parent of the pupil and it was decided that the pupil be taken for further psychological intervention.” The boy will return to school when the new term starts in two weeks. Brakpan police spokesperson Captain Pearl van Staad said the boy's father - the owner of the gun - had fled. Saturday Star
