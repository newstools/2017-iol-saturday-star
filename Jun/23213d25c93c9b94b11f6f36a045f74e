 I was 15 and extremely rebellious when I got my first tattoo. It was Timon, from The Lion King. It hurt like hell and I swore I'd never do it again. That one no longer exists, though; it was covered up, covered up again and then removed. &quot;I then got a second one when I was 19, with my first pay cheque. It was some flash art off a tattoo parlour s wall. When I was a teen, not much thought went into getting a tattoo. I was 23 when I got my third and what I thought would be my final tattoo. I didn t get tattooed for another five years. Then in 2010 I was viciously attacked. I was raped, tortured and left for dead, and all I could think while I was recovering was how I could make myself as unapproachable and unattractive as possible. I shaved the sides of my head, I stretched my 4mm earlobes to 16mm to make them more noticeable and I started getting tattooed. &quot;I realised getting tattooed became my therapy. The pain I felt from being a canvas to an exceptionally talented artist was a pain I could deal with. It was a pain that made my emotional pain and suffering bearable. &quot;I'm not sure how many individual pieces I ve got, I ve never really counted. I do have some amazing pieces of work, though. I have a portrait of Tupac on my thigh and that always seems to surprise people. Sarah Midgley Joburg @SamNaik01Saturday Star
