A group of South Africans this evening gathered outside the London office of Bell Pottinger in the latest protest against the PR company accused of spinning state capture and sowing racial divisions. 
The protesters sung the South African National Anthem and other protest songs as Londoners headed home.
Some of them, according to protesters, stopped and asked what the picket was about.
Others carried placards.   
The purpose of the protest was to hand over a memorandum of demands to the PR firm that included making public their work with the Gupta’s, declaring all funds received for their services and using those funds to build schools or donations to NGOs.
The picket came as the DA at home confirmed that Bell Pottinger had met its deadline to respond to the opposition party’s complaint that it had violated the Public Relations and Communications Association’s Professional Charter and Code of Conduct. 
The DA in a statement said they are awaiting a copy of the submissions. 
These submissions will be referred to a Committee who will consider if a disciplinary hearing should be held. 
If it is decided, the hearing is likely to be held, according to the DA on August 16, 17 or 18 in London. The Saturday Star
