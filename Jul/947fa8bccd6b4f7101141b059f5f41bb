President Jacob Zuma has launched a scathing attack on the judiciary, warning that courts undermined democracy and that they cannot continue to take decisions on behalf of the democratically elected government. Addressing thousands of ANC delegates at Nasrec, Soweto, yesterday, Zuma said opposition parties were quick to run to the courts when they lose political battles in Parliament. He said it must not be allowed that a government was always subjected to litigation by the opposition.Zuma and National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete were recently taken to court on the secret ballot in the motion of no-confidence against him.The Constitutional Court has ruled that Mbete has powers to decide on the secret ballot and the ball was in her court.Mbete was expected to make the decision on the matter soon.Opposition parties have in the past three years launched more than 20 court battles against Zuma and some of his ministers and state-owned entities.He said ANC branches must not allow unelected structures to take decisions on behalf of the people. The use of the courts to oppose our policies and programmes will always continue. He said the bigger question was why democracies would spend money in the courts.Zuma asked if it was the democracy they wanted where people go to court where there was no majority.He said when the opposition loses debates in Parliament it runs to the courts. This is a counter to democracy, he said.It was unconstitutional for a democratically elected government to be forced to change its decisions because of the courts.Zuma also said the courts have already warned parties not to burden them with court applications.He also warned the ANC to get its act together to avoid going to the courts because opposition parties went to court at the drop of the hat.Zuma has faced several battles in the courts over the last few years with the number of cases against and his government increasing.He was taken to court on the Nkandla matter, and lost the case.His case on the spy tapes is scheduled before the Supreme Court of Appeal later this year.Zuma was also forced to backtrack on the appointment of Menzi Simelane as head of the National Prosecuting Authority a few years ago after the court ruled the appointment invalid.Zuma had a meeting with the judiciary last year to iron out differences.The Saturday Star
