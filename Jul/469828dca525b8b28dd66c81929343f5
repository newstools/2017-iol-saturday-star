In a country filled with so much fresh produce, I can t help but to add some of its wonderful fruit to my cooking. It is said an apple a day keeps the doctor away . I wonder if you could count this delicious cake as your apple a day? Apples are really healthy, the apple skin is filled with antioxidants. Another interesting fact is that an apple tree takes four to five years to bear its first fruit.With all this in mind, let's appreciate the gorgeous bounty found in our beautiful country.
