 I was lonely. I didn't know anyone at my new school. I had been there for just over a month and still didn't have anyone to hang out with. I didn't really want to be here. I was kind of bitter that I was forced to be at a school with all these strangers. It was my own fault though. I had been kicked out from my school in KwaZulu-Natal and needed to find a new school. My dad was really upset. He bought me a plane ticket to come down to Joburg where he lives and enrolled me at this school. I had no option but to pack my bags. One day during assembly I overheard a guy talking about rap music to his friends. My eyes lit up immediately. I am crazy about rap. I went over and started a conversation with him. A teacher walking by caught us chit chatting and sent us to stand in front of the whole school. After assembly that day, we spent hours talking about rap music, and our ambitions of becoming rappers. He welcomed me into his friend circle. It was amazing, because I felt like a loner for such a long time. We spent each day together writing rhymes and rapping together at break time and after school. Today we've got an established rap group called T Rowdie and have written many songs together. We've even spent some time in studio and recorded some songs. He is one of my best friends and we spend the majority of our days together working on our dream of becoming rappers. I think AKA is the best rapper in the country, he thinks Cassper Nyovest is. But we both agree that we'll be South Africa's most recognised rappers one day. @SamNaik01The Saturday Star
