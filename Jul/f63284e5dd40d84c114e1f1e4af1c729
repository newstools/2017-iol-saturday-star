DA spokesperson Phumzile Van Damme said: "Based on the outcome of the PR and Communications Association (PRCA) investigation and what it says, we could take action domestically. "We could get full disclosure of what the Guptas were up to.” The investigation should be finalised by next week. On Thursday, Bell Pottinger issued a press release apology over claims in which “it was said that we had supported or aided campaigns to stir up racial division in South Africa”. “Duduzane Zuma, in his capacity as a Gupta employee, procured the services of the PR firm in what seems to have been an attempt to divide and conquer the South African public by exploiting racial tensions to keep  President Jacob Zuma and the ANC in power." Bell Pottinger allegedly used social media platforms in a campaign to stir racial divisions. South Africans could have another avenue to make the UK firm accountable. They could lodge a complaint against the PR company with the SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) if they felt any of their rights, as contained in the Bill of Rights, were violated. Gushwell Brooks of the SAHRC said: “Our focus is the Bill of Rights and for someone to bring a complaint to us it would have to be linked to one of the rights as contained in the Bill of Rights. "We will then investigate a matter.” Saturday Star
